#  INVESTIGATION REPORT

# JEREMY BOWERS is the murderer!!!

# Because of the following reasons:
# 1. From the crime scene report we can find that we have two witnesses, 
#    (a) One who lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr"
#	 (b) And the other whose name is "Annabel" and lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave"

# 2. (a) Our first witness 'Annabel' said that she saw the murderer last week on her gym on 09.01.2018, 
# 	 (b) Our second witness 'Morty Schapiro' said that:
#		(i) 	He saw a man running out, after hearing a gunshot.
#		(ii) 	He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag
#		(iii)	The membership number started with "48Z" - Only "Gold Members" have that kind of bag.
#		(iv)	The man got into a car whose number plate included the following initials - "H42W"

# 3. After getting the car details, I found out that there were total 3 persons (1 Female and 2 Males) with the number plate including "H42W" in it.
#	 (a) Suspect 1 : Jeremy Bowers/ ID: 67318
#    (b) Suspect 2 : Tushar Chandra/ ID: 51739

# 4. After reviewing the membership status of the gym, I found out that there were 2 persons with the "Gold Membership" and "48Z" initials on their gym bag.
#	 (a) Suspect 1 : Joe Germuska
#	 (b) Suspect 2 : Jeremy Bowers

# 5. After analysing, 
#	 I found out that the murderer was 'Jeremy Bowers' who was a gold member at the gym, with bag no: "48Z55" who murdered on 15.01.2018, and 
#	 then fled with his car having number plate "0H42W2".
