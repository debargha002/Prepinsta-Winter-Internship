# Prepinsta-Winter-Internship

In week 1, we have been given 2 excel datasets (both raw and cleaned) and a metadata of the file. We have to use `conditional formatting`, `pivot tables`, `charts`, `data cleaning`, apply arithmetic and conditional functions and finally build a dashboard out of it and present the insights. We have to do `Exploratory Data Analysis`.
