Create a functional dashboard in Google Sheets/Excel to analyze and visualize data related to bike buyers. Your dashboard should provide insights into the behavior and preferences of bike buyers.

- ### Week 2 Task:- Develop a simple game in Python titled â€œFrog and Leap"
The Frog and Leap game is a classic puzzle game where we have to switch the positions of the green and brown frogs to win the game.

**RULES OF THE GAME:-**
1) The left set of frogs can only move right, the right set of frogs can only move left.
2) Frogs can move forward one space, or move two spaces by jumping over another frog from opposite side.
3) The puzzle is solved when the two sets of frogs have switched positions sucessfully.
