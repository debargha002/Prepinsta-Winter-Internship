# Week 7 Asisgnment
## India's Air Quality Data (Tableau and Python)

### Context
Environmental pollution, especially air pollution, is a growing global concern. With 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution, it's crucial to analyze and understand the data. In this Tableau Dashboard project, I explored India's air pollution levels over the years, aiming to correlate changes with environmental policies.

### Dashboard Components
#### 1. Map Visualization
Geographical maps display air quality levels across Indian states.
Color-coded markers based on Air Quality Index (AQI) offer visual clarity.
#### 2. Time Series Charts
Time series line charts showcase air quality changes over the years.
Data grouped by months or years to identify patterns and trends.
#### 3. Policy Change Timeline
Integrated timeline component highlighting key environmental policy changes.
Correlate these events with air quality variations.
#### 4. Filter Options
User-friendly filters for selecting specific states, periods, or pollutant types.
Customizable views based on user interests or research questions.
#### 5. Comparative Analysis
Comparative charts illustrate air quality differences between states or regions.
Bar charts or line charts showcase variations in air quality metrics.
#### 6. Top Pollutant Analysis
Identification and display of top pollutants contributing to poor air quality.
Bar charts or pie charts represent the proportion of each pollutant.
#### 7. Insightful Annotations
Annotations highlight specific data points, events, or trends.
Context and explanations provided for better understanding.

### Brief About Dataset:
Combined and cleaned version of Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India.
**Key dimensions:** `Stn_code`, `Sampling_Date`, `State`, `Location`, `Agency`, `location_monitoring_station`, `pm2_5`, `Date`, `Type`.
### Air Quality Measurements:
So2 & No2: Most dangerous outdoor air pollutants.
RSPM: Produced from combustion processes, vehicles, and industrial sources.

**Key measures:** So2 (Sulfur dioxide), No2 (Nitrogen dioxide), Rspm (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter), Spm (Suspended Particulate Matter).
