There are 2 `.ipynb` files uploaded, where one is the raw file without edit and the other file being the solution of the problem statements. A `.pdf` file is also uploaded in case the python notebook fails to view/open on github.

**An error occurred using nbformat v5.8.0 and nbconvert v7.3.1** is displayed everytime if I try to open/view my notebook from github.
